        "description": "<b>Trekarta</b> is designed for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, cycling, boating and all other outdoor activities. It uses offline maps so you do not need to have internet connection. You can easily import places and tracks from GPX and KML data formats or create places in application and share them to others. It lets you write the track of your journey, even in background, so you will never get lost and be able later see where you've been.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Offline maps</b>\r\n\r\nTrekarta uses OpenStreetMap based vector maps that are lightweight, offline and are constantly enhanced by contributors. Maps contain detailed topological data with elevation contours. Some map elements can be filtered out for cleaner look. Trekarta has built-in hillshades support. You can add custom maps in sqlite or mbtiles format to cover your area of interest. Custom maps will be shaded as well. Such maps can be created by yourself with SAS.Planet application from mostly any online source or converted with MapTiler and other applications from other map formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Hiking</b>\r\n\r\nSpecial hiking activity mode emphasises paths and tracks on map. It visualizes path difficulty and visibility and displays hiking routes. It also displays special OSMC symbols that help you identify desired route.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cycling</b>\r\n\r\nCycling activity mode reveals bicycle infrastructure. It shows cycling routes and visualizes mountain biking track difficulty and visibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Skiing and skating</b>\r\n\r\nSkiing activity mode displays clean winter map with mostly all skiing activities: downhill, nordic, hiking and touring. As a bonus freestyle snow-boarding, skating and sleighing areas are displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Off-road</b>\r\n\r\nUnpaved, dirt, winter and ice roads are specially visualized. 4wd only roads have specific marking. Fords are displayed on all roads, even primary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Places</b>\r\n\r\nPlaces can be easily imported from GPX and KML files or can be created within application. You can navigate to places and share them with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Tracks</b>\r\n\r\nTrekarta is designed to record tracks of your journey. Simply press a button when you start and press it once more when you finish. You can quit the application if you do not need to look at the map, the track will be recorded in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Plugins</b>\r\n\r\nTrekarta functionality can be extended by plugins. Currently the following plugins are available:\r\n\u2022 Location sharing\r\n\u2022 Dropbox sync\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More info</b>\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fandreynovikov.info%2Ftag%2Ftrekarta.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw33KxzRhe9zuwuq8KQFE6W1\">https://andreynovikov.info/tag/trekarta.html</a>\r\n\r\nQuestions can be asked at:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fandreynovikov%2Ftrekarta%2Fdiscussions&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw112Kx6dZEc5wv8M0aJHwju\">https://github.com/andreynovikov/trekarta/discussions</a>",

Organic Maps stores the bookmarks in an inaccessible folder (you need to root your device to have the access). The only way to backup this user data is to use a Google service, which is not what I want, or exporting the bookmarks manually, and individually for each bookmark list. Unfortunately, all the user data is also removed if you uninstall the application. The latest update caused the app to become unable to start, so, having no other option, I reinstalled it. This removed all the bookmarks. In maps.me, an app I migrated from, the bookmark files are easily accessible locally and every time you add some places to your bookmarks the bookmark files are updated. Also, all the user files are kept intact if you are forced to reinstall the application. In these aspects, Organic Maps seems like a beta still, when compared with maps.me.",

Misfortunes never come singly as they say, so in addition to snow, wind, coldness, and the famous Swedish winter darkness my phone battery was about to run out. To save the battery I switched into flight mode - Organic Maps kept working flawlessly. Organic Maps had enough details for us to follow the trail precisely using GPS. We could not see the trail because of the snow but we could follow it using GPS - so good OpenStreetMap data is. Compare how \"Fulufj\u00e4llet nationalpark\" looks like in Google Maps vs OpenStreetMap and you will see what I am talking about.

        "description": "Loop helps you create and maintain good habits, allowing you to achieve your long-term goals. Detailed charts and statistics show you how your habits improved over time. The app is completely ad-free, open source and it respects your privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Simple, beautiful and modern interface</b>\r\nLoop has a minimalistic interface that is very easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.\r\n\r\n<b>Habit score</b>\r\nIn addition to showing your current streak, Loop has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress, unlike other don't-break-the-chain apps.\r\n\r\n<b>Detailed graphs and statistics</b>\r\nClearly see how your habits improved over time with detailed charts and statistics. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habits.\r\n\r\n<b>Flexible schedules</b>\r\nSupports not only daily habits, but also habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.\r\n\r\n<b>Reminders</b>\r\nCreate an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the notification, without opening the app.\r\n\r\n<b>Widgets</b>\r\nTrack your habits directly from your home screen, with beautiful and colorful widgets.\r\n\r\n<b>Completely ad-free and open source</b>\r\nThere are absolutely no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The complete source code is available under an open-source license (GPLv3).\r\n\r\n<b>Works offline and respects your privacy</b>\r\nLoop doesn't require an Internet connection or online account registration. Your confidential habit data never leaves your phone. Neither the developers nor any third-parties have access to it.\r\n\r\n<b>Take your data with you</b>\r\nIf you want to further analyze your data or move it to another service, Loop allows you to export it to spreadsheets (CSV) or to a database format (SQLite).",

Joplin is also available for Windows, macOS and Linux and all can synchronise with each others so your notes can be available on your mobile phone, computer, tablet, etc. Please see the official website for the list of available applications: https://joplinapp.org/\r\n\r\nThe desktop applications can be used to import notes from Evenote via .enex files, including the formatted content (which is converted to markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.).

Set up multiple choice answers to make the tracking process super quick, track everything in seconds!\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set up powerful line graphs that allow you to visualise data whether tracked occasionally or consistently. See moving averages over various time periods from various data sources on the same graph.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set up pie charts to clearly show the proportions of data.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set up statistics to report useful information like the time since something was tracked or the average time between tracking something. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Separate everything into groups to take full advantage of the flexibility of the app. Track habits, symptoms and a workout routine all in different groups. Then create groups for any graphs and statistics too.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Organise any page to your liking by simply holding down and dragging items around.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack & Graph is completely free and open source.

Same for other daily tally data sets. If you added a '+1' & 'reset to zero' at a custom time, that would greatly improve it. Still, I am very pleased with what's on offer here. *response: I want to see specific mood differences throughout the day in relation to coffee's drunk. I.e. does a cup of coffee cause mania, mood dip etc? After how many coffees does my mood alter significantly? Do my energy levels fall off after coffee three? Simply using a daily total does not tell me this information, it's not specific enough to demonstrate mood and energy shifts minutes and hours apart. Don't get me wrong, I can work around it, but adding my proposed additions would resolve the issue entirely and allow more flexible data entry and interpretation. Just a suggestion.

        "description": "Element is both a secure messenger and a productivity team collaboration app that is ideal for group chats while remote working. This chat app uses end-to-end encryption to provide powerful video conferencing, file sharing and voice calls.\r\n\r\n<b>Element\u2019s features include:</b>\r\n- Advanced online communication tools\r\n- Fully encrypted messages to allow safer corporate communication, even for remote workers\r\n- Decentralized chat based on the Matrix open source framework\r\n- File sharing securely with encrypted data while managing projects\r\n- Video chats with Voice over IP and screen sharing\r\n- Easy integration with your favourite online collaboration tools, project management tools, VoIP services and other team messaging apps\r\n\r\nElement is completely different from other messaging and collaboration apps. It operates on Matrix, an open network for secure messaging and decentralized communication. It allows self-hosting to give users maximum ownership and control of their data and messages.\r\n\r\n<b>Privacy and encrypted messaging</b>\r\nElement protects you from unwanted ads, data mining and walled gardens. It also secures all your data, one-to-one video and voice communication through end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification.\r\n\r\nElement gives you control over your privacy while allowing you to communicate securely with anyone on the Matrix network, or other business collaboration tools by integrating with apps such as Slack.\r\n\r\n<b>Element can be self-hosted</b>\r\nTo allow more control of your sensitive data and conversations, Element can be self-hosted or you can choose any Matrix-based host - the standard for open source, decentralized communication. Element gives you privacy, security compliance and integration flexibility.\r\n\r\n<b>Own your data</b>\r\nYou decide where to keep your data and messages. Without the risk of data mining or access from third parties.\r\n\r\nElement puts you in control in different ways:\r\n1. Get a free account on the matrix.org public server hosted by the Matrix developers, or choose from thousands of public servers hosted by volunteers\r\n2. Self-host your account by running a server on your own IT infrastructure\r\n3. Sign up for an account on a custom server by simply subscribing to the Element Matrix Services hosting platform\r\n\r\n<b>Open messaging and collaboration</b>\r\nYou can chat with anyone on the Matrix network, whether they\u2019re using Element, another Matrix app or even if they are using a different messaging app.\r\n\r\n<b>Super secure</b>\r\nReal end-to-end encryption (only those in the conversation can decrypt messages), and cross-signed device verification.\r\n\r\n<b>Complete communication and integration</b>\r\nMessaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, screen sharing and a whole bunch of integrations, bots and widgets. Build rooms, communities, stay in touch and get things done.\r\n\r\n<b>Pick up where you left off</b>\r\nStay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronised message history across all your devices and on the web at https://app.element.io\r\n\r\n<b>Open source</b>\r\nElement Android is an open source project, hosted by GitHub.
