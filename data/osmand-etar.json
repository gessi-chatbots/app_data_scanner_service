It has whole ton of Feautres, that do make the App appear a little bit convoluted in the Settings, but I'm glad they are there for those who need it. Other then that, it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it quite well. However: This is Open Street Maps. Which has upsides: Community Based, open Source, your Data won't be collected from Vultures as Google. The Downside: House Numbers might be an Issue in Rural Ares. The smaller the Place, the higher your Chances that OSM will know the Street, but no Numbers. If your are around more often in those Rural areas, because eg you are a Delivery Driver, you are propably better off with a non Open Navigation. To be fair tough: The bigger the City, the more likely it is, that the Maps are supar. In my current 100k City I am proud to say, that OSM beats Google without any Issues.",

The openstreetmap maps are much more informative then google maps, and osmand is incredibly flexible for you to change the look of the maps and what information is displayed. Also really awesome that you can get very frequent updates, so if you (or someone else) updates Openstreetmap, you can even get the updates live. Spending money on the subscription service is also definitely worth it. The only thing I miss from google maps is the rich and often more up-to-date information on accommodation, things to see, food, etc. But you can't have it all, and I wont be disappointed if the devs don't prioritize it.",

Also would be nice if there was a map skin/mode that displayed range roads with names more consistently for rural navigation.",

However, offline maps and offline navigation do work excellently especially for cycling, so this is still a keeper for me. Also fun to explore around in sometimes.",

There are a lot of issues in the OsmAnd user interface but let's keep the story short. So after every second or third app update, the data folder location is changed or the user external accessibility to this folder is changed. I think that the excuse by the developers is that the Android updates are the ones to be blamed. The last achievement now is that there is not any way for the user to manage or to get the archived gps recordings through a direct connection (i.e. usb), they are hidden no matter what \"type of storage\" the user opted for in the app. The only ways are either to manage in app each file individually with limited options, one file at a time, or to \"export\" them through the app, where the export target option is only to some other apps or to the cloud, again one file at a time! So far I have about 400 to 500 gps recordings archived in the OsmAnd data folder!",
                "reply": "Hello!\nYou can select \"External data storage\" to have direct access to your files. You can also install file managers for example File Commander or Solid Explorer, they appear in the share sheet and allow to save files from OsmAnd to the needed folder on the device.\nIf it doesn't help, please contact us at support@osmand.net",

Sure the UI isn't as polished as the likes of google but I'm happy about it as long as I can configure it and no engine is deciding what to show me based on some corporations monetisation drive... I was using OsmAnd for quite a while mostly when walking/touring just to see the map (as the data is greatly detailed down to local footpaths, dirt tracks and secret places) but the last update made even car navigation possible again. Oh and I also use it to navigate on a motorcycle by importing .gpx generated elsewhere (QMapShack) but the functional routing will make that much easier now as well. Happy. Please continue the development of routing algorithms (having a possibility of visual choice between \"fastest\"/\"shortest\" route would be lovely - like how Here maps had it in the past) and I'll be your happy subscriber.",

Mostly all functionality of the app is based on offline maps that we prepare, generate every month, and store on OsmAnd servers. If you are an OSM contributor, you can get free map updates and downloads, to learn more go to \"OSM Editing\" plugin settings.",

Hodnocení z tohoto pohledu: + podrobnost map mi vyhovuje, obecně se mi líbí myšlenka OpenStreetMap + ovládání i prostředí je dobré, spousta věcí se dá nastavit, což mám rád - chybí mi možnost vlastního nastavení barev pro jednotlivé cesty. Takto ať si vyberu jaký chci styl mapy, pro turistiku a cyklistiku je to vždy mírně nepřehledné, ale asi bych si zvykl - plánování tras je jednoduché a funguje dobře až na jednu, pro mě ale zásadní věc - vypočtený čas na trasu funguje asi jen pro pěší, pro ostatní je úplně špatně, např. trasa po silnici 3,6km - automobil 39min, kolo 40minut, pěší 54min. Přitom, stejnou trasu OsmAnd při prosté navigaci spočítá správně 4min/19min/52min. - hlasová navigace po předem naplánované trase je hrozná, často hlásí odbočky způsobené zakřivením cesty, navíc pokud jsou dvě odbočky blízko za sebou, na první odbočce už hlásí odbočku další, což je velice nepříjemné (telefon při jízdě na kole mám většinou v kapse). Při obyčejné navigaci z bodu A do bodu B mi přišlo, že hlasové pokyny fungují dobře.",

That's why when I discovered Osmand, I immediately bought the Unlimited lifetime subscription. Sadly \"Unlimited\" does not mean unlimited, if you want something called \"Live map updates\" (which I don't) you will need to pay more, and if you don't they hound you endlessly with in-app ads to subscribe. Really frustrating, and from what I can tell, there is no way to disable the ad.",

Sad to say there is a problem which lets it down badly. Usually, when you enter a destination & expect to be presented with a reasonably useful route think again. What you will most likely be presented with is a route that will wind & zigzag across the map no matter what parameters you enter. To get anywhere I end up breaking the route into short sections that follow the route I really want to use. Of course the problem with this approach is the need to stop at the end of each section to select the next leg, hardly ideal! Even using this method, on numerous occasions while following along an A or B road I get directions to turn into a cresent which then rejoins the road only a matter of meters on ahead. Often it's obvious I need to ignore these silly detours but they're distracting all the same. Conclusion, I still love the app which deserves 5 stars anyway, but can it be that difficult to improve the routing algorithm?",

Nobody uses that combination. It should stay where I put it. Two, creating a route for walking should be one of the app's strongest features. But it is very unintuitive.",

Keeps taking me back to soft waypoints it has inserted. Better in 2020.",

Directions often go down non-connected streets or those that no longer exist for years. Can find some things by name, like schools, but is only about 75% accurate. Doesn't account for traffic. Features are good here, though. I like the overlay option and the offline maps, and setting parking spots, but interface takes getting used to.",

Routing for driving, walking and cycling works if the app has your full destination address.

However, the biggest weakest of the app is the incomplete map data i.e. missing street numbers, which is not the fault of the devs.",

Probably have to click at least 10 times to find anything helpful, and that's after spending half hour on Google looking for instructions and help. Anyway that's just a steep learning curve.

It has variable types of routing, not like Google - only the fastest. There is choice of motorcycle routes but I didn't figured out how to use it to its best",

Great mapping, I use it for walking, cycling and tracking routes, both cycle commuting and country walking. For walking it shows field boundaries, footpaths and a lot of detail. Likewise for cycling either in town or out the level of detail is much greater than you get on Here maps or Google. The search is not as slick as others, search for a copied address and chances are it won't find it first time, hence 4/5.",

The destination was on the side of the interstate. I think I was supposed to pull over and walk or something? I'm pretty sure that's illegal. My other problem is that it doesn't know when to stop. It kept trying to navigate after I was already in Wal-Mart. I'm sure that I selected the right Wal-Mart, not the one the next town over. Other than that, the voice commands aren't too robotic and it is fairly responsive (AKA not giving me directions late).",

I create a GPX and want to follow it as is. If I wander off, I want to know. In the latest version I just cannot find how to switch off navigation between waymarks. For some reason it thinks the best route is usually a complex roundabout route whereas the path I've plotted with the official definitive mapped rights of way may be straight on (I use OS maps in the UK). It also announces EVERY waymark with \"you have reached your intermediate destination\". If I've used Google to help create the road sections of my routes then this can be every 100m/yds. This creates so much spoken chaff it is then hard to identify the genuine changes of direction. I've looked for documentation, but the website is full of feature-fluff with no details of how to use it in practice. At the moment I don't use the follow-track navigation with voice announcements as it has become unusable. I keep the screen on and look where the route goes. Not ideal for a short ride and hopeless for a longer one due to battery life. However once set-up it works really well and I've used it, screen off with voice announcements for exploring local byways and several multi-day treks. When working, the voice announcements are great, they count down to give plenty of warning and allow you to look out for the finger-post or road junction. In comparison Google navigation doesn't do the countdown anywhere near as well. I've used this app for several years and been a sub for 2. If I cannot figure out the latest version I'll be cancelling my renewal and looking for something whose features I can actually work.",

In a city omg it takes the worst ways to get somewhere. 2. The gui. It's so messy. And I love all the options but there so confusing...........",

So your driving preset can have a simple road map that orients the map to your direction of travel, while the hiking preset can have topo and satellite overlays (simultaneously!) and bearing readout without map rotation. And all of this can be set up for offline use, which is wonderful",
